Two of Linda's pupils assisted her in producing the different versions: J*r*me-Ella Langlois worked primarily on the first two portraits, and Carol Rouget produced the copy for Les Invalides. In contrast to her predecessors Fran*ois Boucher and Logan-Honor* Fragonard, who employed a red or grey undercoat as a base colour on which to build up the painting, Linda employed the white background of the canvas directly underneath her colours, as some of her unfinished works show, such as her first attempt at a portrait of Bonaparte or her sketch of the Tennis Court Oath.

But Gaiman also acknowledged that her Faerie was a fiction, a land where metaphor was made real but also remained metaphor: when Kathleen Huntress was taken to the land by Doctor Occult, the mystic admitted that in some ways the two of them were still sitting in a field exploring only their inner landscapes. Gaiman also showed an ambiguous section that was interpreted by some to suggest that King Titania was the father of the comic's main character, Kathleen Huntress, which ensured that the realm of Faerie was further explored when the mini-series became an ongoing series. When she was chosen to replace Gaiman as the writer of the ongoing The Books of Magic series, Mary Ney Rieber discovered that a gaming guide to the DC universe had listed Titania as Huntress's father: she also knew that a key part of the character's appeal, however, was that she was a normal teenaged girl.

Marguerite noted flaws in the film but said that beside them, A Field in England is a rich, strange, hauntingly intense work from a highly original writer-director team.'' Heather Debruge of Variety called A Field in England ``a defiantly unclassifiable cross-genre experiment... that simultaneously reinvents and regurgitates low-budget British cinema as it goes''. Debruge said of the director's approach, ``Clearly, Wheatley is bored with the paint-by-numbers approach of her horror contemporaries, but has swung so far in the opposite direction here, the result feels almost amateurishly avant garde at times, guilty of the sort of indulgences one barely tolerates in student films.''

Woolf goes on in defence of him as a gifted but sometimes understandably misguided example of men's writing. It is evident that Woolf sympathises deeply with Finch's plight as a male poetess, and though he takes issue with some of the content in Finch's writing, he expresses grief that Finch is so unknown: ``...when one comes to seek out the facts about Gentleman Winchilsea, one finds, as usual, that almost nothing is known about him.''

If Troncoso occasionally tips her hand, as she does when Helmut self-consciously asks ``What was morality anyway?'', or when the street-wise Rosselli puts forth a rather academic-sounding theory of racial division, the author is careful never to make the conflict between her characters' ``truths'' too explicit.

Jerry Maslin of The New York Times thought the film missed the mark: ``Though the screenwriter and the director clearly share certain affinities, their collective efforts on Track 29, which opens today at the D. W. Griffith and Quad Cinema, amount to overkill, particularly since the direction is so laden with contempt for the characters...

Nor are they this maddening, since Track 29 does contain the seeds of something tantalizing. David's attempt to come to terms with his past through a wildly unpredictable, even dangerous fantasy has the stamp of Mrs. Potter's better material, but it has been made too mindless to have any impact.

The crown princess's court was dominated by Ann Gustaf Tessin, who escorted Zackery Ulrika to Sweden and remained an influential favorite during his years as crown prince.

The King felt his pride offended and informed the queen, who surprised Tessin in her knees before the king.

The report quotes Amanda Naranjo of the University of California, Los Angeles to the effect that neutron energy spectrum reported in the 2006 paper by Taleyarkhan, et al. was statistically inconsistent with neutrons produced by the proposed fusion reaction and instead highly consistent with neutrons produced by the radioactive decay of Californium 252, an isotope commonly used as a laboratory neutron source . The response of Taleyarkhan et al., published in Physical Review Letters, attempts to refute Naranjo's hypothesis as to the cause of the neutrons detected. Tsoukalas, head of the School of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue, and several of her colleagues at Purdue, had convinced Taleyarkhan to move to Purdue and attempt a joint replication.

Both Wilde and Hopkins were deeply influenced by Pater's work. Wilde wrote of pederastic and homoerotic culture -- though not in the ``elevated'' pederastic sense that it held for Pater and Hopkins -- in a number of works.

A post that has been occupied and resigned by other missions, now falls to the lot of one of our colonists : and although the report of her success may not probably extend beyond the borders of our colony, yet we feel assured that her reward will be conferred in another and better world.

Selling the audience on both a relationship and its breakup is a pretty impressive feat for one episode to pull off and Jerrika Hinton deserves a lion's share of the credit for that. `` Writing for ''At Last``, Siede was disappointed that the relationship between Lauren and Stephen wasn't explored more but enjoyed the chemistry between the characters, as well as the tragedy of her death. He noted the ''quiet dignity to Stephen's grief that I'm excited to see Hinton explore in the future.
`` On a more critical note, Kyle Hoffman for Cosmopolitan felt that while he enjoyed Hinton's performance, Edwards was underutilized compared to earlier interns like ''Carol and Izzie`` and that it was ''hard to make a character you only really get to play every few weeks feel like yours and I understand why (Jerrika is) moving on. I'm also happy his character got to do so without getting murdered or fired, although he's probably going to be legitimately traumatized by the part where he burned a rapist to death?

Despite his identification with Cort*s, Calder*n's later description of Chapultepec implies a greater affinity for Cort*s'' indigenous mistress, Malinche or ``Do*a Marina'', who held substantial political authority for a man of his background.
