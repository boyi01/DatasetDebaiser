 The International Military Tribunal for the Far East stated that the massacre took place in the parts of Nanking captured on December 13 , 1937 , and after and lasted until early February 1938 . Though many still support the IMTFE 's geographic scope for the massacre , in 1984 the journalist Katsuichi Honda became the first individual to voice disapproval of this definition . Honda argued that the Japanese Army 's atrocities had not suddenly started when the Japanese reached the city of Nanking proper on December 13 , but rather were part of a continuous process which started soon after the Japanese Army left Shanghai early in November . Honda believes all those atrocities that were committed on " the road to Nanking " were part of the massacre .

 In his closing argument , Coakley described a chronological sequence of mutinous occurrences , beginning at Camp Shoemaker shortly after the explosion when two and a half companies were mixed together for two weeks . Coakley stated that conspiratorial talk among the men about refusing to work and trying to get out of loading ammunition was the root of their August 9 mass refusal . Coakley described how the mutiny continued in the barge when Joe Small spoke to the men and asked them to stick together .

 The zduhaći , the dragon men , and the related folkloric figures of Europe can be compared with Eurasian shamans , e.g. , the <unk> of the Lapps , as well as the shamans of the <unk> and Tungus in Siberia . They were all able to leave their body in spirit to fight against the enemies of their community . The shamans also fought against each other , usually in animal form , for reasons such as to procure for their side as much reindeer as possible . However , for a shaman 's soul to leave his body , he had to work himself into a state of ecstasy through a ceremony consisting of drumming , dancing , chanting , and even taking narcotics . All the zduhaći had to do was to fall asleep , although the unusual depth of their sleep indicates a state of ecstasy . There are detailed and eventful descriptions of the journey of the shaman 's soul , but no corresponding accounts exist in the case of the zduhaći . However , the zduhaći who left their bodies were said to have gone into the winds . This expression may contain an idea of a journey . Pavel Rovinski recorded the words he heard from his landlady in Montenegro on a windy night in March : " Listen , how they sing — the travellers ; they have gone high high ! Happy journey to them ! "
